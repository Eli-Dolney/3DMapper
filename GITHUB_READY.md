## 🖥️ Next: Clone on Windows RTX 4080

### Step 1: Clone Repository

```powershell
cd D:\projects  # or your preferred location
git clone https://github.com/Eli-Dolney/3DMapper.git
cd 3DMapper\AutomatedTracker
```

### Step 2: Follow Windows Setup

See **[WINDOWS_SETUP.md](AutomatedTracker/03_documentation/WINDOWS_SETUP.md)** for:
1. NVIDIA driver installation
2. CUDA 11.8 + cuDNN setup
3. FFmpeg installation
4. COLMAP GPU build
5. Running the pipeline

**Expected with RTX 4080:**
- 30-second video → 8-15 minutes
- 2-minute video → 40-60 minutes

### Step 3: Process Your Video

```powershell
# Copy video
copy "C:\Users\YourName\Videos\my_drone.mp4" "02_videos\"

# Run pipeline
bash .\05_scripts\run_all.sh

# Results will be in: 04_scenes\my_drone\
```

---

## 📤 Export to Google Drive for Blender

After processing completes:

```powershell
# Navigate to results
cd 04_scenes\video_name

# Create archive (all necessary files for Blender)
tar -czf results.tar.gz undistorted\

# Upload results.tar.gz to Google Drive
# Download on any machine with Blender
```

### Import in Blender

```
Blender → File → Import → COLMAP Model
    ↓
Navigate to: undistorted/ folder
    ↓
Enable:
  ✓ Suppress distortion warnings
  ✓ Import points as mesh
    ↓
Click "Import COLMAP Model"
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Repository not found"**
- Verify public access: https://github.com/Eli-Dolney/3DMapper
- Check GitHub authentication

**"Clone fails on Windows"**
- Ensure Git is installed: `git --version`
- Check internet connection
- Try HTTPS (not SSH) as shown above

**"Script won't run"**
- Use `bash` explicitly: `bash .\run_all.sh`
- Ensure chmod on macOS: `chmod +x 05_scripts/*.sh`

**"COLMAP not found"**
- Follow WINDOWS_SETUP.md section 4
- Verify PATH includes COLMAP bin directory

**"GPU not detected"**
- Run `nvidia-smi` to verify drivers
- Check CUDA installation: `nvcc --version`
